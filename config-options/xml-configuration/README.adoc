= XML Configuration

This example demonstrates how to use XML configuration instead of the java config-api,
 to configure WildFly Swarm.


== Referencing standalone.xml


To reference a `standalone.xml` it can be part of your project, where it's picked up automatically,
or you can pass it to WildFly Swarm with a `-c` parameter:

[source,xml]
----
include::pom.xml[lines=39..45]
----

See: link:pom.xml#L42[pom.xml]

== Subsystem configuration in XML

You can then have any subsystem configuration external in `standalone.xml`.
These configuration will then be matched with the corresponding fractions automatically.

[source,xml]
----
include::../standalone.xml[lines=130..147]
----

See: link:../standalone.xml#L130[standalone.xml]
