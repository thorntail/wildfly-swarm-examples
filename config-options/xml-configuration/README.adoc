= XML Configuration

This example demonstrates how to use XML configuration instead of the java config-api,
 to configure WildFly Swarm.


== Referencing standalone.xml


To reference a `standalone.xml` you need to bootstrap a `Container` with an URL pointing to your file:

[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/org/wildfly/swarm/examples/config/xml/XmlMain.java[lines=16..37]
----


== Subsystem configuration in XML

You can then have any subsystem configuration external in `standalone.xml`.
These configuration will then be matched with the corresponding fractions automatically.

[source,xml]
----
include::src/main/resources/standalone.xml[lines=130..147]
----
