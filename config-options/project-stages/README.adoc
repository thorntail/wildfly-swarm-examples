= Project Stages

Project stages are a way to move environment specific configuration properties
into an external file.

== project-stages.yml

I.e. declaring the database configuration for your production environment externally
(`project-stages.yml`) would look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
include::src/main/resources/project-stages.yml[]
----

== Using expressions for configuration attributes

Within WildFly Swarm you could then reference the configuration property as
 `database.connection.url`. This can be used to configure subsystem, fractions or application code.

To make use of the configuration property for configuration of a subsystem,
you would simply need to reference the property through an expression for a specific attribute
in the configuration model (aka config-api):

[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/org/wildfly/swarm/examples/config/projectStage/ProjectStagesMain.java[lines=15..39]
