= JPA, JAX-RS, CDI and JTA with Shrinkwrap Example

This example uses JPA, JTA (transaction), CDI, JAX-RS resources deployed through a user-provided
`main()` programmatically without constructing a `.war` file during the build.

== Project `pom.xml`

This project is a normal maven project with `jar` packaging, not `war`.

[source,xml]
----
<packaging>jar</packaging>
----

The project adds a `<plugin>` to configure `wildfly-swarm-plugin` to
create the runnable `.jar`.

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <mainClass>org.wildfly.swarm.examples.jpajaxrscdijta.Main</mainClass>

To define the needed parts of WildFly Swarm, a few dependencies are added

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>jaxrs</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>cdi</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>transactions</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
    
The `org.wildfly.swarm:jpa` dependency allows usage of ShrinkWrap APIs within the `main()`,
provides configuration classes for adding the JDBC driver and datasources to the container,
in addition to providing the JPA APIs.  The `org.wildfly.swarm:cdi` and `org.wildfly.swarm:jaxrs`
dependencies provide the CDI and JAX-RS APIs. The `org.wildfly.swarm:transaction` provides JTA API.

Additionally, the JDBC driver jar you wish to deploy is specified as a dependency
within your `pom.xml`

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
  <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.187</version>

== Project `main()`

Since this project deploys CDI and JAX-RS resources without a `.war` being constructed, it
provides its own `main()` method (specified above via the `wildfly-swarm-plugin`) to
configure the container and deploy the resources programmatically. Additionally,
it deploys the JDBC driver jar using a simplified Maven GAV (no version is required)
and deploys a datasource.

[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/org/wildfly/swarm/examples/jpajaxrscdijta/Main.java[lines=19..46]
----

This method constructs a new default Swarm, which automatically
initializes all fractions (or subsystems) that are available.

The datasources fraction has no particular default configuration, so by providing a
specific configuration we enable a driver and a datasource.

JNDI names are bound automatically.

We prevent the JPA fraction from automatically configuring a default datasource
as we want to define that ourselves.

The empty container is started.

A `JAXRSArchive` is constructed, and the JAX-RS resource class is
added to it, along with the JPA Entity class, CDI bean classes, persistence.xml and load.sql.

By default, if no JAX-RS `Application` is provided a default is added
to the deployment specifying an `@ApplicationPath("/")` to bind the
deployment to the root URL.

== Run

You can run it many ways:

* mvn package && java -jar ./target/example-jpa-jaxrs-cdi-jta-shrinkwrap-swarm.jar
* mvn wildfly-swarm:run
* In your IDE run the `org.wildfly.swarm.examples.jpajaxrscdijta.Main` class

== Use

Request all Employees:

    http://localhost:8080/all
    
Start a transactional removal of all employee that will fail with a rollback:

    http://localhost:8080/remWithRollback

Start a transactional removal of all employee that will fail without a rollback (partial commit):

    http://localhost:8080/remWithoutRollback
