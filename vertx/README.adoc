= WildFly Swarm - Vert.x

This example shows how to add support for the Vert.x API in Java EE applications by enabling the https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-jca[Vert.x JCA adapter].

== Overview

The general purpose of a JCA resource adapter is to provide connectivity to an Enterprise Information System (EIS) from a Java EE application server. Specifically, the Vert.x JCA adapter provides both outbound and inbound connectivity with a Vert.x instance.

== Outbound Connectivity

An application component (e.g Servlet, EJB), can send messages to a Vert.x instance.

Usage:

----

* NOTE: as with any JCA resource, always call the close() method when your work is complete to allow the connection to be returned to the pool. This will *not* close the underly Vert.x instance. Please see the JCA specification for my details.

== Inbound Connectivity

Since the JCA 1.5 specification, inbound connectivity is provided via a listener interface which can be implemented by a Java EE Message Driven Bean (MDB). As opposed to the default JMS listener type, the Vert.x JCA listener interface allows an MDB to receive messages from a Vert.x address.

The endpoint of the MDB implements interface: <b>io.vertx.resourceadapter.inflow.VertxListener</b>.
