# JAX-RS and CDI .war Example

This example takes a normal JAX-RS and CDI build, and wraps it into
a `-swarm` runnable jar.

## Project `pom.xml`

This project is a traditional JAX-RS and CDI project, with maven packaging
of `war` in the `pom.xml`

    <packaging>war</packaging>

The project adds a `<plugin>` to configure `wildfly-swarm-plugin` to
create the runnable `.jar`.

    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
      <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${version.wildfly-swarm}</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
            <goal>package</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>

For this example we're letting the plugin auto detect what dependencies
we might need for our application, so no WildFly Swarm specific dependencies
need to be added.

Additional application dependencies (in this case `lombok`) can be
specified and will be included in the normal `.war` construction and available
within the WildFly Swarm application `.jar`.

## Run

You can run it many ways:

* mvn package && java -jar ./target/example-jaxrs-cdi-swarm.jar
* mvn wildfly-swarm:run
* In your IDE run the `org.wildfly.swarm.Swarm` class

## Use

Since WildFly Swarm apps tend to support one deployment per executable, it
automatically adds a `jboss-web.xml` to the deployment if it doesn't already
exist.  This is used to bind the deployment to the root of the web-server,
instead of using the `.war`'s own name as the application context.
